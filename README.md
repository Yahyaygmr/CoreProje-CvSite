# Core_Proje
-  I prepared this project while I was following the CoreProje camp of my teacher Murat Yücedağ.
-  Although this project is basically a cv site, it also includes an author panel in addition to the admin panel.
-  The user who is a member can be assigned the author or admin role.
-  There is a messaging system (a system similar to E-mail) between users.
-  In addition, notifications can be sent to all users by the admin and users can list these notifications.
-  The front of the page is edited by the admin
